    <h1>Chukwunwike Francis Elioku</h1>
    <p>
        Hey all, My name is Francis Chukwunwike Elioku and I am from Anambra State, And my Local Government is situated at Anambra East but I currently live in Lagos State OJO LGA.
        I am aspiring to become a Front-end Developer before the year runs out, The reason I choose to become a Front-end 
        Developer is because this niche is highly profitable and its a highly sort after Job and I honestly cannot wait to land my 
        first GiG.
        Well before I decided I wanted to go fully into Front-end development I was into Aluminum Fabrication and I also sell mobile devices
        like Iphones, Mac and all types of mobile gadgets. 
        On saturdays I like playing football as its the only means of exercise I engage in and its actually good for your health.
        You should also try it.
    </p>
